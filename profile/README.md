## What is SideFX Houdini?

**SideFX Houdini** is the industry-standard procedural 3D animation and visual effects software used by major film, TV, and game studios worldwide. Unlike traditional 3D packages, Houdini uses a node-based procedural workflow, allowing artists to create complex effects, animations, and environments non-destructively.

With Houdini, digital artists and VFX professionals can:
- Build dynamic simulations like fire, water, smoke, and destruction.
- Create intricate character rigs and animations.
- Design entire worlds using procedural generation.
- Iterate quickly with non-destructive workflows.

Houdini is known for its powerful toolset in **procedural modeling**, **particle effects**, **volumetric rendering**, and **dynamic simulations**. It is the go-to software for high-end visual effects in blockbuster movies, AAA games, and immersive AR/VR experiences.

Its flexible licensing, including a free learning edition, makes Houdini accessible to students, indie developers, and large studios alike.
